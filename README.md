# GitReference  Matthew Schwarz

Instructions: Create an app that reads a json file of Git commands and displays all of the commands via a ListView. A gitReference.json file is provided.

A wow factor of adding a floating button which would add a new git command to the list was in progress, but was not finished in time for the project to be turned in, so the original version without the button added is being submitted. (The other project is on my GitHub under GitReference2, but it is incomplete).
